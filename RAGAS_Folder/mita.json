    "The family planning services funded through the HHSC Family Planning Program include: Health history and physical examinations, Counseling and education, Laboratory testing, Provision of a contraceptive method, Pregnancy tests, Sexually transmitted infection screenings and treatment, Referrals for additional services as needed, Immunizations, Breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services, Prenatal services, Other services subject to available funding",
    "To handle a planning examination for an additional E/M (Evaluation and Management) office visit that goes beyond the required components for a standard office visit, a client can take the following steps: Understand the Requirements: First, the client should understand what the standard components of an E/M office visit are, and what additional components are being considered for the examination. This involves knowing the criteria for different levels of E/M services as defined by the relevant healthcare guidelines (such as those from the CMS or AMA). Documentation: Ensure that all additional examinations or services provided are thoroughly documented. The documentation should clearly state the medical necessity of these additional components. This includes detailing how the patient’s condition warrants these extra steps and how they are expected to contribute to better diagnostic or treatment outcomes. Communication with Healthcare Provider: The client should discuss with their healthcare provider why these additional components are necessary and how they will benefit the patient's health. Understanding the rationale behind the additional components can also help in explaining the situation to the insurance provider if needed.  Insurance Verification: Before proceeding with the additional components of the E/M visit, check with the insurance provider to verify coverage. This can prevent unexpected expenses and ensure that both the healthcare provider and the patient are clear about what will be covered. Consent: It’s important that the client gives informed consent, acknowledging that they understand what the additional examination entails, the reasons for it, and any associated costs if not covered by insurance.  Follow-Up: After the additional E/M office visit, the client should follow up to receive any results or further instructions. This ensures continuity of care and maximizes the effectiveness of the additional examination components.  By taking these steps, a client can effectively manage and utilize an additional E/M office visit to ensure comprehensive medical evaluation and care.",
    "An emergency behavioral health condition is any condition that, according to a reasonable person without specialized medical knowledge, requires immediate medical intervention. This urgency is due to the potential immediate danger the condition poses to the individual or others, or because it prevents the individual from controlling, understanding, or being aware of the consequences of their actions.",
    "Medicaid physicians require authorization for non-emergency situations primarily to ensure that the treatments or services provided are medically necessary and cost-effective. This process helps manage healthcare costs and prevents unnecessary procedures, aligning with Medicaid's goal to provide efficient and appropriate care to its beneficiaries. Additionally, prior authorization serves as a checkpoint to review the appropriateness of the requested service, based on clinical criteria and patient needs, thereby safeguarding patient health and optimizing resource allocation.",
    "The requirements for an ambulance provider to bill for ET3 services, based on the provided context, include: Transporting a client to an alternative destination other than an emergency department, such as an urgent care clinic, mental health center, or Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), based on the evaluation of the client's condition. Initiating and facilitating appropriate treatment in place (TIP) at the scene of the emergency.  Initiating and facilitating appropriate TIP through telemedicine or telehealth, as defined in the Telecommunication Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks).  These options allow ambulance providers to address the client's healthcare needs more flexibly and appropriately after a 9-1-1 call or other emergency calls, potentially reducing unnecessary visits to emergency departments.",
    "The sources that TPR (Third Party Resources) includes for payments for Texas Medicaid are: Other health insurance including assignable indemnity contracts  Health maintenance organization (HMO) Public health programs available to clients with Medicaid such as Medicare and Tricare  Profit and nonprofit health plans",
    "If a claim was initially sent to the adoption agency before being sent to Texas Medicaid Healthcare Partnership (TMHP), TMHP must receive the claim within 95 days of the date of disposition from the adoption agency. This disposition could be a denial, payment, request for refund, or recoupment. Therefore, the claim should be sent to TMHP within this 95-day period to be considered for payment.",
    "The Third Party Liability (TPL) program supports the provision of payments for managed care to Texas Medicaid clients by recovering payments from third parties that are legally responsible for paying medical claims. This process helps reduce Medicaid costs by shifting the financial responsibility for these claims to the appropriate third party payers, rather than having them solely funded by Medicaid. This ensures that Medicaid can allocate its resources more efficiently and sustainably, supporting the overall management and provision of care to its clients.",
    "The optimal process for submitting Third Party Resources (TPR) claims to Texas Medicaid involves several key steps:Identify TPR Sources: Determine if the client has coverage from other health insurance, HMOs, public health programs like Medicare and Tricare, or any profit or nonprofit health plan.Submit Claim to TPR: Initially, submit the claim to the identified TPR source(s) to determine their liability and the amount they will pay.Assess TPR Payment: After receiving payment from the TPR, assess whether the amount covers the Medicaid-allowable amount for the services provided.Submit Claim to TMHP: If the TPR payment is less than the Medicaid-allowable amount, submit a claim to the Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership (TMHP) for the additional allowable amount.Follow Filing Deadlines: Ensure that claims are submitted within the filing deadlines as specified in Subsection 6.1.4, “Claims Filing Deadlines” in “Section 6: Claims Filing” of the TMHP manual.Handle Denied Claims: If claims are denied or services are not covered by Medicaid, consider submitting these claims to non-TPR sources.Refund Erroneous Payments: If a non-TPR source erroneously makes a payment for a service also covered by Medicaid, refund the payment to the non-TPR source.Contact Provider Relations for Assistance: If there are any uncertainties or specific situations not covered by standard procedures, contact a provider relations representative for guidance.",
    "Clients with disabilities can receive eligibility for Medicaid by meeting specific criteria set by their state. Generally, they must demonstrate that they have a disability as defined by the Social Security Administration (SSA). This often involves providing medical evidence of their disability. Additionally, they must meet certain income and asset requirements, which vary by state. Some states may have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, which could also affect the criteria. It's advisable for individuals to contact their state's Medicaid office to get detailed information about the eligibility requirements and the application process."

        "An emergency behavioral health condition is defined as any condition that, in the opinion of a prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, requires immediate intervention or medical attention regardless of the nature, without which the client would present an immediate danger to himself, or herself or others, or that renders the client incapable of controlling, knowing, or under- standing the consequences of his or her actions.
