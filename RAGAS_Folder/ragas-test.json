  'question': 'How can a client handle a planning examination for an additional E/M office visit beyond required components for an office visit?',
  'ground_truths': ['An annual family planning examination (billed with modifier FP) will not be reimbursed when
  submitted with the same date of service as an additional E/M visit. If another condition requiring an
  E/M office visit beyond the required components for an office visit, family planning visit, or surgical
  procedure is discovered, the provider may submit a claim for the additional visit using Modifier 25 to
  indicate that the client’s condition required a significant, separately identifiable E/M service. Documentation supporting the provision of a significant, separately identifiable E/M service must be maintained
  in the client’s medical record and made available to Texas Medicaid upon request.'

  'answer': 'Provider's Role:
  Assessment and Documentation:
  
  The healthcare provider should conduct a thorough assessment and document all aspects of the visit, including any extended services provided beyond the standard E/M components.

  'question': 'How long will it take for TMHP to receive the claim if it was sent to the adoption agency before?',
  'ground_truths': ['TMHP must receive the claim within 95 days of the date of disposition from the adoption agency denial,
  payment, requests for refund or recoupment, to be considered for payment.''
  ],
  'answer': 'The time it takes for Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership (TMHP) to receive a claim that was initially sent to an adoption agency can vary based on several factors. These factors include the efficiency of the adoption agency in forwarding the claim, the accuracy and completeness of the claim submission, and the specific processes and protocols of TMHP. However, some general guidelines can be provided:
  Adoption Agency Processing Time: The adoption agency must first receive the claim and then forward it to TMHP. This process can take a few days to a few weeks, depending on the agency's internal processing times and workload.
  Mail Delivery Time: If the claim is sent via postal mail, standard mail delivery times apply. This can add a few additional days to the overall timeline, depending on the distance and mail service efficiency.
  Electronic Submission: If the claim is forwarded electronically, this can significantly speed up the process. Electronic claims can be transmitted almost instantaneously, but it still depends on the adoption agency's systems and procedures.
  TMHP Processing Time: Once TMHP receives the claim, they typically process claims within a few weeks. However, processing times can vary based on the completeness and accuracy of the claim, as well as TMHP's current workload.
  In summary, while it is difficult to provide an exact timeframe, the entire process from the adoption agency receiving the claim to TMHP processing it could range from a couple of weeks to over a month. For a more precise estimate, it would be advisable to contact the specific adoption agency and TMHP to inquire about their processing times and any potential delays.',
