Unauthorized disclosure can lead to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nThese specific measures underscore a higher level of protection for HIV status compared to general medical conditions, highlighting the importance of privacy and the potential legal consequences of breaches.",

            "Confidentiality and Privacy. Organizations that receive funds from a state agency for residential or direct client services or programs shall develop and use confidentiality guidelines to protect their clients’ HIV/AIDS-related medical information (HSC §85.115, “Confidentiality Guidelines”). Organizations that fail to adopt and use confidentiality guidelines are ineligible to receive state funds. Employees are not required to reveal their HIV status to employers. All medical information that an HIV-infected employee provides to medical or management personnel is confidential and private. Employers may not reveal this information without the employee’s knowledge and written consent, except as provided by law (HSC §81.103, “Confidentiality; Criminal Penalty”). A suggested policy statement might be, “This agency will protect the confidentiality of employee medical records and information. Written consent of the employee must be obtained to share any confidential information with other",
            "staff. Those with access to confidential information must maintain strict confidentiality and privacy, separating this information from employees’ personnel records. Individuals who fail to protect these employee rights commit a serious offense, which may be cause for litigation resulting in both civil and criminal penalties, and may result in dismissal.” • Coworker Concerns. Employers need to be aware of the concerns that coworkers may have about an HIV-infected coworker. A policy statement that acknowledges employee concerns and offers HIV/ AIDS education helps to increase awareness and decrease fear. Equally important is a policy statement that clarifies the limits of an employer’s response to coworker concerns, e.g., “Employees do not have the right to refuse to work with someone who has any disability."
