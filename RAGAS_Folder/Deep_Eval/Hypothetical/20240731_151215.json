Unauthorized disclosure can lead to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nThese specific measures underscore a higher level of protection for HIV status compared to general medical conditions, highlighting the importance of privacy and the potential legal consequences of breaches.",

Employers need to be aware of the concerns that coworkers may have about an HIV-infected coworker. A policy statement that acknowledges employee concerns and offers HIV/ AIDS education helps to increase awareness and decrease fear. Equally important is a policy statement that clarifies the limits of an employer’s response to coworker concerns, e.g., “Employees do not have the right to refuse to work with someone who has any disability.”",
